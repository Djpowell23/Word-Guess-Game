Homework #3 - Word Guess Game

The only issues that I could not overcome was getting the music to play on the page when the word was guessed correctly. I saw the assignment was extended so I planned to do finishing touches on Monday until I saw this morning it was due at midnight last night. Other than getting the music functions working, I would have spent a little more time on the HTML/Bootstrap/css section of it.
